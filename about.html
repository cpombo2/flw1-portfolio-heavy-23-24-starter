        <p>Your About Banner</p>
        <p> Hi! My name is Christian Pombo. But I tend to go by Chris. I'm currently a 17 year old senior attending Marble Hill School of International Studies. I have an immense amount of love for the city of New York.</p>
        
       <p> I plan to double major in both computer science and business/finance. Thus expanding my career into Fintech, a mix ture of finance and tech, where I can help people financially using technology and perhapsn hep solve a major problem when it comes to dealing with paper and transactions. I am huge advocate for authenticity and so I believe in fashion, music, and taste shaping one's aesthetic. In my free time, I design clothes, am currently learning Japanese, study photography, and consistently go to the gym. </p>
